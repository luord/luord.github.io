## On learning

Having shown these pies, it goes without saying that the percentages there are mostly presumptions of mine.
One can't know with 100% certainty how much one knows about these technologies because, in this beautiful field, things change rapidly.

That said, I am confident to say that my primary skill is __learning__. I've always been a fast learner (for example, I graduated high school
when I was 13) and picking stuff up is what I do best. I got my very first job fresh after graduating and yet, four months later, I had already gotten a raise.

So, consider my skills above not as a metric of how well I know these technologies and principles, but on how  well/quickly I think I
can pick them up and adapt them to a project based on my experience on them.
