title: Memorized Rules
summary: Principles I consciously follow.
status: hidden

The other day, I read an article by Julian Shapiro about
[actionable advice](https://www.julian.com/blog/memorized-rules) and
how he collects it as particular "memorized rules". Also recommending
to write up to six of them down to keep them present; updating them as
one changes or they become irrelevant.

So here are mine, in no particular order:

- "There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work."  
 —Paul Graham.

- “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say ‘no’ to almost everything."  
 —Warren Buffet.

- "Think about what you'd like to become more often than thinking about what you'd like to get."  
 —David Heinemeier Hansson.

- "When you have trouble with procrastination, before you use the hammer of discipline, ask: “How can I make this compelling and irresistible?”"  
 —[Stepan Parunashvili](https://stopa.io/).

- "You just keep going 'til you get something. [...] You gotta keep forcing it, forcing it, forcing it."  
 —John Mayer.

- "Keep it simple stupid."  
 —Kelly Johnson.
