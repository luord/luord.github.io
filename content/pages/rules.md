    The other day, I read an article by __Julian Shapiro__{ .p-author} about
    [actionable advice](https://www.julian.com/blog/memorized-rules){ .u-url} and
    how he collects it as particular _"memorized rules"_{ .p-name}. Also recommending
    to write up to six of them down to keep them present; updating them as
    one changes or they become irrelevant.
