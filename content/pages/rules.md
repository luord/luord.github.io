status: hidden

The other day, I read an article by __Julian Shapiro__{ .p-author} about
[actionable advice](https://www.julian.com/blog/memorized-rules){ .u-url} and
how he collects it as particular _"memorized rules"_{ .p-name}. Also recommending
to write them down, and to keep at most six of them present; updating them as
you change or they become irrelevant.

So here are mine, in no particular order:

- “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say ‘no’ to almost everything."  
 —Warren Buffet.

- "There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work."  
 —Paul Graham.

- "The true currency of life is time, not money, and we've all got a limited stock of that."  
 —Robert Harris.

- "You just keep going 'til you get something. [...] You gotta keep forcing it, forcing it, forcing it."  
 —John Majer.

- "Keep it simple stupid."  
 —Kelly Johnson.

- "When you have trouble with procrastination, before you use the hammer of discipline, ask: “How can I make this compelling and irresistible?”"  
 —Stepan Parunashvili.
