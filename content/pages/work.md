## On Work

I like helping people or teams improve their code—including where that code lives and how it's
written and deployed—and I'm sure I can help you if you're currently facing
problems with too much technical debt, a slow or tediously manual development
cycle, low testing coverage, problems with observability or management of deployments,
difficulty with feedback loops in the process, or most other problems related to
delivering a functional application.

I have over ten years of experience (not counting college) primarily with web
development, and I know a thing or two about writing maintainable code both in
the backend (mostly Python; Go to a lesser extent) and the frontend in JS/TS.
I've had responsibilities both updating legacy applications and migrating them
to more modern stacks _and_ I've also written applications from scratch and taken them to MVP
status and beyond. This is to say, I have experience with making decisions on architecture
and infrastructure, and I've also led and mentored other developers.

### Ways I can help:

- **Software Development**: My favorite, I can write clean and maintainable code (and tests) for your application or platform.
- **Operations**: I can help with the building, testing, deployment, and monitoring of the code, including automating the process for continuous integration.
- **Code Review**: I can provide feedback on the work of other developers, as well as mentoring if need be.
- **Architecture**: I can help with initial brainstorming and prototyping options for the structure of new applications, or the target for migrations.
- **Technical Writing**: I can write articles about the technologies you use or case studies worth sharing from your engineering process.

Working together, we can turn those technical liabilities into technical
assets. If this sounds like something you need a(n extra) hand with, [hit me up][contact], or if you
want details on my experience, it's [here][cv].
