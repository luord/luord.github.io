## On Work

I like helping people at improving their code—including where that code lives and how it's
written and deployed—and I'm sure I can help you if you're currently facing
problems with too much technical debt, a slow or tediously manual development
cycle, low testing coverage, problems with observability or management of deployments,
difficulty with feedback loops in the process, or most other problems related to
delivering a functional application.

Working together, I can help you or your team turn those technical liabilities into technical
assets.

I have ten years of experience (not counting college) primarily with web
development, and I know a thing or two about writing maintainable code both in
the backend (mostly Python; Go to a lesser extent) and the frontend in JS/TS.
I've had responsibilities both updating legacy applications and migrating them
to more modern stacks _and_ I've also written applications from scratch and taken them to MVP
status and beyond. This is to say, I have experience with making decisions on architecture
and infrastructure, and I've also led and mentored other developers.

If this sounds like something you need a(n extra) hand with, [hit me up][contact], or if you
want details on my experience, it's [here][cv].
