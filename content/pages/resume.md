# Overview

Systems Engineer, by degree, with interest and focus in Software development and Infrastructure management. Follower of good development practices and, as a perfectionist, keen on refactoring and vying to keep my code maintainable.

More than three years of experience as a full-stack developer writing web applications, services and their clients. I gravitate toward backend work with REST architectures.

Practitioner of DevOps, always trying to learn new and better ways to ease the development, testing and deployment processes.

* Backend development with a strong preference for Python with PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.
* Infrastructure setup, on premise or cloud based. Maintenance of continuous automatic deployment and testing. Normally using docker, ansible, git hooks and, specially, bash scripts.
* Consulting for development and infrastructure, as well as integration of both.
* Frontend web development, if required, from existing designs.
