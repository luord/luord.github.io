Not everything is programming and, thus, this page is about what I like... besides programming.

# Film
I'm a cinephile. I've watched and enjoyed many movies of every genre and different 
time periods. I tend to gravitate towards contemporary movies while still 
watching classics from time to time.

Since I also love writing about movies, I'll publish reviews and comments on cinema every once in a while.

# Music
I like music and I listen to many genres, though I generally prefer
contemporary commercial music: mostly rock and some pop. I also enjoy jazz and classical from time to time.

Given that I'm usually most interested in the vocals, I tend to prefer properly trained singers. This is why I listen
to a lot of showtunes or opera, and not that many instrumentals.

# Literature
I used to read a lot of fiction, before I got my first computer. I'm trying to pick the habit back up and I'm reading and
planning to read several classics and contemporary novels.

# Checklist
* I'm not much of a traveler, but I wouldn't say no to visiting London, Berlin, New York, Moscow and Sidney.
* I want to (re)learn basic vocal technique and learn basic movement.
* I might write a fantasy novel some day.
