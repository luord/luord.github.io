summary: Who I am in general
status: published
order: 1

I am Luis Orduz, from Colombia. I have a degree in Systems Engineering, which, in here, is a rough equivalent to Software Engineering in the USA.
For a detailed rundown of my skills, go [here][skills]; and for details on my experience click [here][resume].

I'm interested in movies, literature and music. Although music I mostly enjoy listening and rarely bother discussing; cinema and
literature I might talk about every once in a while, specially cinema. There's more about what I like [here][interests].

I started this blog because I felt like I needed one and also because it could be a good
presentation letter for potential clients, since I'm a freelancer. Also for practicing my writing and,
hopefully, having discussions about what I write.

I had a hard time deciding whether to carry this blog in Spanish or English. Ultimately I settled on English
because [Eric Raymond recommends it][htbah] and to him I listen.

Thank you for visiting my website!
