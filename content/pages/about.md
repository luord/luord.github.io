## Me

I am Luis Orduz, a software engineer who also likes operative work. Or, to put it
another way, I got a degree in Systems Engineering[^syseng] back in 2013 and
have been working (mostly) as a full-stack web application developer that
sometimes handles (some) infrastructure management ever since. If you want a
rundown of my experience, go [here][cv]. For a "mission statement" of sorts,
[here][mission].

Writing code has been my passion ever since I got my first computer as a high
school graduation present. So much so that I quickly realized that chemical
engineering, my first major, was absolutely not for me. I endured it for a year
and a half before ultimately dropping out and switching to the aforementioned
systems engineering. Luckily, I graduated high school at fourteen (giving me
a leeway of two years[^ages], exactly what I ended up wasting) so my
parents weren't *too* mad. This meant that not only I was studying what I
actually wanted, but I could finally study alongside people my own age[^deal]. I
haven't looked back since.

I like coding so much that I do it in my spare time too, which is why this site
exists and why I sometimes contribute to open source projects or answer
programming questions in Q&A websites. I hope I get to keep doing this until I
retire, and even after that.

But enough of code, I do like a couple of other things:

Movies
: I've watched and enjoyed many movies of every genre and different time periods.
I don't go out of my way to watch old or independent movies[^cine] because I
prefer contemporary stuff, but I do watch arthouse or oldies every now and then.

    Something to note here is that I rarely watch movies at home as I consider going
to the theater an important part of the experience[^tv].

    I've rated and reviewed over a
thousand movies and can talk about them for hours.

Literature
: I read and write fiction, a lot. Mostly short stories because I don't have the
time for full novels, but I do try to read the odd novel every now and then and
also hope to publish a novel (or cycle) of my own some day. I don't have a
set favorite genre as I read horror, historical fiction, romance, crime,
thrillers, etc., but I do gravitate toward fantasy and, to a lesser extent,
science fiction.

    I read a ton of non-fiction too, mostly technology articles
and essays.

Music
: If I'm walking down the street, chances are that I'm completely lost and
unaware of my surroundings, singing along to whatever is blasting from my
earbuds. I prefer contemporary music, *mainly* rock and some pop, with the odd
film or musical theater song here and there.

    If I'm coding, odds are
that I'm listening to movie or videogame soundtracks, with the odd classical
piece here and there.

Other stuff
: I'm not much of a traveler, but I wouldn't say no to visiting London, Berlin, New York and Sidney.

    I want to learn to carry a tune and to stop having two left feet.

    I might start practicing self-defense or a martial art some day.

Well, that's enough about me I guess. To close, I must say that I had a hard
time deciding whether to carry this blog in Spanish or English.
Ultimately I settled on English for the reasons mentioned by Eric Raymond
[here][htbah].

Thank you for visiting my website!

[^syseng]: In Colombia, this is Computer Science with more calculus and physics, basically.
[^ages]: Over here, students usually finish high school and start college at 16/17.
[^deal]: This actually was a big deal for me. I had been the "little kid" since second grade.
[^cine]: This is why I don't consider myself a "cinephile".
[^tv]: This is also why I rarely watch TV series.
