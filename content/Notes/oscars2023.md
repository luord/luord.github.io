title: Asinine Oscars

The Oscar nominations came out today and to the surprise of nobody, the year's
mediocre critical darling of choice "everything everywhere all at once" got the most
nominations. I actually thought it was passable when I first watched it, but seeing so
many people saying it was so awesome made me watch it a second time to see if I had
missed something. It only made me find it even more pointless and boring, and I ended
up hating it and lowered the original rating I gave it.

But really, the worst sin of these nominations is the total snubbing of "The Northman",
which deserved at the very least a Best Director nomination. And while I'm very happy
for "Top Gun: Maverick", "All Quiet on the Western Front", "Elvis" and, specially, "Elvis"'s
frontman Austin Butler getting the recognition they of course deserve, his nomination
only reminds me of how Taron Egerton was ignored three years ago for "Rocketman" while
one of Joaquin Phoenix's worst performances not only got nominated but won. Really, it was
the 2020 Best Actor shenanigans what made me lost what little faith I still had back then
for the Oscars, so at this point I'm just beating a dead horse.

All that said, credit where it's due: Certain uncomfortably revisionist movie everyone was calling
a shoo-in for multiple nominations too was ignored, so that automatically means
the academy has at the very least a saner head on its shoulders than some other award voters.
