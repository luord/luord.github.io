Well damn, I was tentatively excited about everything going on regarding large language models
and how they're being used, until today it was brought to my attention how they behave
when the questions are political in nature. Safe to say, impartial they're not, and the excitement
I used to feel instantly became dread. The only silver lining I see is the belief
that the people who would use these models to confirm their biases would already do so in other ways,
and the people who know better would know not to treat them as source of truth regarding political
issues.

Somehow, that thought did not make me feel better.
