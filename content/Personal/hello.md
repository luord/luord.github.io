summary: I, Luis Orduz, hereby start my blog.
date: 14-03-2016

I'm a Software Developer and, as such, the first entry of my blog is
to be a *Hello World* page, which I now proceed to write in Python...

	:::python
	print("Ahoy!")
    
... and browser ECMAScript (or JavaScript if you prefer, which I don't).

	:::js
	console.log("Good Day.")
	
So... that's it for today.

UPDATE: I decided to dedicate my site mostly to Software after all.
