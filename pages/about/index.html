  <h2>Me</h2>
<p>I am Luis Orduz, a software engineer who also likes operative work. Or, to put it
another way, I got a degree in Systems Engineering<sup id="fnref:syseng"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:syseng">1</a></sup> back in 2013 and
have been working (mostly) as a full-stack web application developer that
sometimes handles (some) infrastructure management. If you want a
rundown of my experience, go <a href="https://luord.com/pages/cv/">here</a>. For a "mission statement" of sorts,
<a href="https://luord.com/pages/work/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Writing code has been my passion ever since I got my first computer as a high
school graduation present. So much so that I quickly realized that chemical
engineering, my first major, was absolutely not for me. I endured it for a year
and a half before ultimately dropping out and switching to the aforementioned
systems engineering. Luckily, I graduated high school at fourteen (giving me
a leeway of two years<sup id="fnref:ages"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ages">2</a></sup>, exactly what I ended up wasting) so my
parents weren't <em>too</em> mad. This meant that not only I was studying what I
actually wanted, but I could finally study alongside people my own age<sup id="fnref:deal"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:deal">3</a></sup>. I
haven't looked back since.</p>
<p>I like coding so much that I do it in my spare time too, which is why this site
exists and why I sometimes contribute to open source projects or answer
programming questions in Q&amp;A websites. I hope I get to keep doing this until I
retire, and even after that.</p>
<p>But enough of code, I do like a couple of other things:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Movies</dt>
<dd>
<p>I've watched and enjoyed many movies of every genre and different time periods.
I don't go out of my way to watch old or independent movies<sup id="fnref:cine"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cine">4</a></sup> because I
prefer contemporary stuff, but I do watch arthouse or oldies every now and then.</p>
<p>Something to note here is that I rarely watch movies at home as I consider going
to the theater an important part of the experience<sup id="fnref:tv"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tv">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I've rated and reviewed over a
thousand movies and can talk about them for hours.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Literature</dt>
<dd>
<p>I read and write fiction, a lot. Mostly short stories because I don't have the
time for full novels, but I do try to read the odd novel every now and then and
also hope to publish a novel (or series) of my own some day. I don't have a
set favorite genre as I read horror, historical fiction, romance, crime,
thrillers, etc., but I do gravitate toward fantasy and, to a lesser extent,
science fiction.</p>
<p>I read a ton of non-fiction too, mostly technology articles
and essays.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Music</dt>
<dd>
<p>If I'm walking down the street, chances are that I'm completely lost and
unaware of my surroundings, singing along to whatever is blasting from my
earbuds. I prefer contemporary music, <em>mainly</em> rock and some pop, with the odd
film or musical theater song here and there.</p>
<p>If I'm coding, odds are
that I'm listening to movie or videogame soundtracks, with the odd classical
piece here and there.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Other stuff</dt>
<dd>
<p>I'm not much of a traveler, but I wouldn't say no to visiting London, Berlin, New York and Sidney.</p>
<p>I want to learn to carry a tune and to stop having two left feet.</p>
<p>I might start practicing self-defense or a martial art some day.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, that's enough about me I guess<sup id="fnref:rules"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rules">6</a></sup>. To close, I must say that I had a hard
time deciding whether to carry this blog in Spanish or English.
Ultimately I settled on English for the reasons mentioned by Eric Raymond
